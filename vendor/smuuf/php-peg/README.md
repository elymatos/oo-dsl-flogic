# PEG parser-generator for PHP

This is a minimally invasive fork of [hafriedlander/php-peg](https://github.com/hafriedlander/php-peg).

It contains the following fixes:

- Support for Composer autoloading (courtesy of [hnesk/php-peg](https://github.com/hnesk/php-peg)
- A fix for a segfault caused by catastrophic backtracking in a regex.
